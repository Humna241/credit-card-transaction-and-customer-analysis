**Created a Power BI dashboard for Credit card Transactions and Credit card Customers**

**KPI Summary**:
Total Revenue: 55M

**Insights & Recommendations:** 

1. Blue credit card generates high revenue among them.
2. Businessmen, graduates, and married persons contribute the most.
3. Swipe transactions generate twice the revenue as compared to chip and online methods.
4. Texas and New York contributed the most with high and medium income groups.
5. Revenue peaked in Q2 (mid-2023) but declined in Q4; we need some strategy to increase at the end of the fiscal year.
